# 1. Image classification models - biomedical data

Improve and tailor the current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for image classification (ResNet, DenseNet, VGG, and Google's latest EfficientNetV2) as support for biomedical decision-making. Additionally, by combining them with sequencing/methylation data.

Recent advancements:

# 2. Neoantigen Prediction - cancer vaccines

- Continue building my own custom pipeline <a href="https://github.com/mxvp/NeoLizard" >NeoLizard</a>
- Train custom machine learning model for predicting MHC-binding sites. Compete against MHCFlurry (open source but underperforming), netMHCpan (closed source, good performance).
- Continued collaboration with NeoLizard / potential collaboration with MyNeo?

# 3. SOLID technology for genomics

- In addition to the popular advances of using SOLID technology for incorporating medical data, genomics data from various technologies should be added as well, due to the following reasons:
    - Moore's Law: DNA sequencing costs continuously decrease; in the near future, sequencing will be essential in both general and specialized healthcare. To avoid redundant sequencing runs and variable qualities, genome sequencing results should be saved to a POD, and access should be in control of the patient/client.
    - People empowerment, security, decentralization,...
    - Due to the decreasing cost, the popularity of personal genomics will keep increasing. Open-source trait-discovery services should be encouraged, preferably locally run. The copious number of companies that offer these services, based on a business model that includes sample processing, is an increasing security risk for people's genetic data.
