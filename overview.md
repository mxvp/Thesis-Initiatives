# 1. Image classification models - biomedical data

Improve and tailor current state of art convolutional neural networks for image classification (Resnet, Densenet, VGG and Google's latest EfficientNetV2) as support for biomedical decision making. Additionally by combining it with sequencing/methylation data.

Recent advancements:

# 2. Neoantigen Prediction - cancer vaccines

- Continue building custom pipeline <a href="https://github.com/mxvp/NeoLizard" >NeoLizard</a>
- Train custom machine learning model for predicting MHC-binding sites. Compete against MHCFlurry (open source but underperforming), netMHCpan (closed source, good performance).
- Continued collaboration with NeoLizard / potential collaboration with MyNeo?

# 3. SOLID technology for genomics
