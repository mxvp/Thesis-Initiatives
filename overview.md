# 1. Image classification models - biomedical data

Improve and tailor the current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for image classification (ResNet, DenseNet, VGG, and Google's latest EfficientNetV2) as support for biomedical decision-making. Additionally, by combining them with sequencing/methylation data.

- Methylation profiling plays an important role in subtyping, most commonly for categorizing tumors, but it can also be utilized for other illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease.
- Decision-making in medical imaging is experiencing significant improvements due to machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks. A holistic model that integrates imaging with sequencing/profiling could lead to even more improvements and warrants further investigation.

Own projects:
- Comparative analysis of methylation profiling in induced neurons  from Alzheimer's patients: <a href="https://github.com/mxvp/Omics-Analysis-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease/blob/main/paper.pdf" >here</a>
- Organelle multilabel classifier: <a href="https://github.com/mxvp/organelle-image-classification/blob/main/organelle_image_classification.ipynb" >here</a>

# 2. Neoantigen Prediction - cancer vaccines

- Continue building my own custom pipeline for neoantigen prediction <a href="https://github.com/mxvp/NeoLizard" >NeoLizard</a>
- Train a custom machine learning model for predicting MHC-binding affinities. Compete against MHCFlurry (open source but underperforming), netMHCpan (closed source, good performance).
- Continued collaboration with NeoLizard / potential collaboration with MyNeo?

# 3. SOLID technology for genomics

- In addition to the popular advances of using SOLID technology for incorporating medical data, genomics data from various technologies should be added as well, due to the following reasons:
    - Moore's Law: DNA sequencing costs continuously decrease; in the near future, sequencing will be essential in both general and specialized healthcare. To avoid redundant sequencing runs and variable qualities, genome sequencing results should be saved to a POD, and access should be in control of the patient/client.
    - People empowerment, security, decentralization,...
    - Due to the decreasing cost, the popularity of personal genomics will keep increasing. Open-source trait-discovery services should be encouraged, preferably locally run. The copious number of companies that offer these services, based on a business model that includes sample processing, is an increasing security risk for people's genetic data.

# 4. Assessing the industry impact of bioinformatics-driven AI/ML integration in biotech startups

- GOAL: Quantify the industry-wide impact of integrating Bioinformatics-driven AI and ML in biotech startups located in biotech hubs San Francisco and Boston.
- Methodologies:
    - Identify biotech startups involved in genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, or precision medicine.
    - Interviews and data collection to explore how AI/ML integration impacts their research, development, operational efficiency, market positioning, and competitive advantage.
    - Evaluate industry impact and comparative analysis
    - Generate analysis and Recommendations for Bioinformatics-Driven Biotech Startups

- Preparation: Business course in summer & student consulting club

# 5. Drug repurposing for rare diseases

The goal is to illustrate the possibility of repurposing existing drugs for rare diseases, aiming to accelerate the drug development process and reduce redundant costs.

- Identify potential drug candidates for the treatment of rare diseases
- Develop a framework based on machine learning that predicts drug-disease interactions
- Incorporate drug libraries, genetic information, and disease pathways
- Estimate potential economic impact by employing market analysis methods.

Examples:
- Thalidomide: sedative and anti-nausea medication with severe teratogenic effects in the late 1950 is now used to treat multiple myeloma.
- Enbrel: arthritis medicine (Pfizer), developed for treating arthritis, has shown potential for repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease.
